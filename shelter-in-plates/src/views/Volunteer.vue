                                The social media coordinator is at the heart of every restaurant campaign.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In order to drive meaningful results for a restaurant, we need to activate and engage their community, diners, and fans who <em>already</em> have a relationship with them, either through dining there before, being a part of the neighborhood that the restaurant serves, or having a personal connection to the team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The social media coordinator makes this happen by working over the course of a 5 day campaign to help a restaurant achieve it's goals.
                            </p>

                                <strong>5 hours.</strong> You can meaningfully help a restaurant in 5 days, 1 hour per day.

                            <p>
                                We'll provide a step by step checklist and playbook for how you can do this, and we'll work with you closely to execute a campaign.
